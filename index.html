                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS changes that. CSS puts the designer in the driver's seat. We devote much of the rest of this book to explaining what you can do with CSS. In this chapter, we begin by introducing you to the basics of how to write style sheets and how CSS and HTML work together to describe both the structure and appearance of your document.

        <article>
            <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
            <img src="img/css-declaration-small.png" alt="The names of the individual parts">
            <p>
                <h3>Selector</h3>
                This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <code class="css-string">&lt;p&gt;</code> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
                <h3>Declaration</h3>
                This is a single rule like <code class="css-string">color: red;</code>.
                It specifies which of the element's <strong>properties</strong> you want to style.
                <h3>Properties</h3>
                These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
                <h3>Property value</h3>
                To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the <strong>property value</strong>. This chooses one out of many   possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many <code class="css-string">color</code> values in addition to <code class="css-string">red</code>.)
            </p>
            <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. (<code class="css-string">{}</code>)</li>
                <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (<code class="css-string">:</code>) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
                <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (<code class="css-string">;</code>) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>p {
    color: red;
    width: 500px;
    border: 1px solid black;
  }</code>
            </pre>
            <p>You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>p, li, h1 {
    color: red;
  }</code></pre>

        <article>
           <p>Now that we've explored some CSS fundamentals, let's improve the appearance of the example by adding more rules and information to the <code class="css-string">style.css</code> file.</p>
           <ol>
               <li>First, find the output from Google Fonts that you previously saved from What will your website look like?. Add the <code class="css-string">&lt;link&gt;</code> element somewhere inside your index.html's head (anywhere between the <code class="css-string">&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code class="css-string">&lt;/head&gt;</code> tags). It looks something like this:</li>
    <pre clas="css-link"><code>&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>This code links your page to a style sheet that loads the Open Sans font family with your webpage.</p>
            
            <li>
                Next, delete the existing rule you have in your style.css file. It was a good test, but let's not continue with lots of red text.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the following lines (shown below), replacing the <code class="css-string">font-family</code> assignment with your font-family selection from What will your website look like?. The property <code class="css-string">font-family</code> refers to the font(s) you want to use for text. This rule defines a global base font and font size for the whole page. Since &lt;html&gt; is the parent element of the whole page, all elements inside it inherit the same <code class="css-string">font-size</code> and <code class="css-string">font-family</code>.</li>

                <pre class="css-note-long"><code>html {
    font-size: 10px; /* px means "pixels": the base font size is now 10 pixels high  */
    font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; /* this should be the rest of the output you got from Google fonts */
  }</code></pre>
                <p class="css-note"><strong>Note:</strong> Anything in CSS  between <strong>/*</strong> and <strong>*/</strong> is a <strong>CSS comment</strong>. The browser ignores comments as it renders the code. CSS comments are a way for you to write helpful notes about your code or logic.</p>
            <li>
                Now let's set font sizes for elements that will have text inside the HTML body (<code class="css-string">&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code class="css-string">&lt;li&gt;</code>, and <code class="css-string">&lt;p&gt;</code>). We'll also center the heading. Finally, let's expand the second ruleset (below) with settings for line height and letter spacing to make body content more readable.
            </li>
                <pre><code>h1 {
    font-size: 60px;
    text-align: center;
  }
                      
p, li {
    ont-size: 16px;    
    line-height: 2;
    letter-spacing: 1px;
    }</code></pre>
            
           </ol>

        <article>
           <p>Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about boxes. This includes setting size, color, and position. Most HTML elements on your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of other boxes.
           CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space on your page has properties like:
            </p>
            <img src="img/boxes.jpg" alt="a lot of boxes,made of timber, on top of each other"> 
            <ul class="list-marge-between-strings">
                <li><code class="css-string">padding</code> the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.</li>
                <li><code class="css-string">border</code> the solid line that is just outside the padding.</li>
                <li><code class="css-string">margin</code> the space around the outside of the border.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="img/box-model.png" alt="css element's structure based on a box and the name of the stucture box model">
            <ul class="list-marge-between-strings">In this section we also use:
                <li><code class="css-string">width</code> (of an element).</li>
                <li><code class="css-string">background-color</code>, the color behind an element's content and padding.</li>
                <li><code class="css-string">color</code>, the color of an element's content (usually text).</li>
                <li><code class="css-string">text-shadow</code> sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.</li>
                <li><code class="css-string">display</code> sets the display mode of an element. (keep reading to learn more).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Styling the body</h3>
            <pre><code>body {
    width: 600px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background-color: #FF9500;
    padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;
    border: 5px solid black;
  }</code></pre>
        <ul class="list-marge-between-strings">There are several declarations for the <code class="css-string">&lt;body&gt;</code> element. Let's go through these line-by-line:
            <li><code class="css-string">width: 600px;</code> This forces the body to always be 600 pixels wide.</li>
            <li><code class="css-string">margin: 0 auto;</code> When you set two values on a property like margin or padding, the first value affects the element's top and bottom side (setting it to 0 in this case); the second value affects the left and right side. (Here, auto is a special value that divides the available horizontal space evenly between left and right). You can also use one, three, or four values, as documented in Margin Syntax.</li>
            <li><code class="css-string">background-color: #FF9500;</code> This sets the element's background color. This project uses a reddish orange for the body background color, as opposed to dark blue for the  &lt;html&gt; element. (Feel free to experiment.)</li>
            <li><code class="css-string">padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;</code> This sets four values for padding. The goal is to put  some space around the content. In this example, there is no padding on the top of the body, and 20 pixels on the right, bottom and left. The values set top, right, bottom, left, in that order. As with margin, you can use one, two, three, or four values, as documented in Padding Syntax.</li>
            <li><code class="css-string">border: 5px solid black;</code> This sets values for the width, style and color of the border. In this case, it's a five-pixel–wide, solid black border, on all sides of the body.</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>Centering the image</h3>
            <pre><code>img {
display: block;
margin: 0 auto;
}</code></pre>
            <p>Next, we center the image to make it look better. We could use the margin: 0 auto trick again as we did for the body. But there are differences that require an additional setting to make the CSS work. 
                The &lt;body&gt; is a <strong>block</strong> element, meaning it takes up space on the page. A block element can have margin and other spacing values applied to it. In contrast, images are <strong>inline</strong> elements. It is not possible to apply margin or spacing values to inline elements. So to apply margins to the image, we must give the image block-level behavior using <code class="css-string">display: block;</code>.</p>

                <article>
                   <p>Here are some general suggestions for ways to keep your stylesheets organised and tidy.
                       <h3>Does your project have a coding style guide?</h3>
                       If you are working with a team on an existing project, the first thing to check is whether the project has an existing style guide for CSS. The team style guide should always win over your own personal preferences. There often isn't a right or wrong way to do things, but consistency is important.
                       <h3>Keep it consistent</h3>
                       If you get to set the rules for the project or are working alone, then the most important thing to do is to keep things consistent. Consistency can be applied in all sorts of ways, such as using the same naming conventions for classes, choosing one method of describing color, or maintaining consistent formatting (for example will you use tabs or spaces to indent your code? If spaces, how many spaces?) Having a set of rules you always follow reduces the amount of mental overhead needed when writing CSS, as some of the decisions are already made.
                       <h3>Formatting readable CSS</h3>
                       There are a couple of ways you will see CSS formatted. Some developers put all of the rules onto a single line, like so:
                       <pre><code>.box { background-color: #567895; }
h2 { background-color: black; color: white; }</code></pre>
                       Other developers prefer to break everything onto a new line:
                       <pre><code> .box {
    background-color: #567895;
  }
    h2 {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
   }</code></pre>
                      CSS doesn't mind which one you use. We personally find it is more readable to have each property and value pair on a new line.

                      <h3>Comment your CSS</h3>
                      <p></p>Adding comments to your CSS will help any future developer work with your CSS file, but will also help you when you come back to the project after a break.</p>
                      <pre><code>/* This is a CSS comment
It can be broken onto multiple lines. *</code></pre>
                        <p>A good tip is to add a block of comments between logical sections in your stylesheet too, to help locate different sections quickly when scanning through, or even give you something to search for to jump right into that part of the CSS. If you use a string which won't appear in the code you can jump from section to section by searching for it — below we have used <code class="symbol">||</code>.</p>
                        <pre><code>/* || General styles */

        ...

* || Typography */

        ...

* || Header and Main Navigation */

        ...</code></pre>
                        <p>You don't need to comment every single thing in your CSS, as much of it will be self-explanatory. What you should comment are the things where you made a particular decision for a reason.
                        You may have used a CSS property in a specific way to get around older browser incompatibilities, for example:</p>
                        <pre><code>.box {
    background-color: red; /* fallback for older browsers that don't support gradients */
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #ff0000, #aa0000);
  }</code></pre>
                          <p>Perhaps you followed a tutorial to achieve something, and the CSS is a little non-obvious. In that case you could add the URL of the tutorial to the comments. You will thank yourself when you come back to this project in a year or so, and can vaguely remember there was a great tutorial about that thing, but where is it?</p>
                   </p> 
                   <h3>Create logical sections in your stylesheet</h3>
                   <p>It is a good idea to have all of the common styling first in the stylesheet. This means all of the styles which will generally apply unless you do something special with that element. You will typically have rules set up for:</p>
                   <ul class="list-marge-between-strings">
                    <li><code class="css-string">body</code>;</li>
                    <li><code class="css-string">p</code>;</li>
                    <li><code class="css-string">h1</code>, <code class="css-string">h2</code>, 
                         <code class="css-string">h3</code>, 
                         <code class="css-string">h4</code>, 
                         <code class="css-string">h5</code>;</li>
                    <li><code class="css-string">ul</code> and <code class="css-string">ol;</code></li>
                    <li>The <code class="css-string">table</code> properties;</li>
                    <li><code class="css-string">Links</code>.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>In this section of the stylesheet we are providing default styling for the type on the site, setting up a default style for data tables and lists and so on.</p>
                   <pre><code>/* || GENERAL STYLES */

body { ... }

h1, h2, h3, h4 { ... }

ul { ... }
                    
blockquote { ... }</code></pre>
                   <p>After this section we could define a few utility classes, for example a class that removes the default list style for lists we're going to display as flex items or in some other way. If you have a few things you know you will want to apply to lots of different elements, they can come in this section.</p>
                   <pre><code>/* || UTILITIES */

.nobullets {
list-style: none;
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
}

    ...</code></pre>
                   <p>Then we can add everything that is used sitewide. That might be things like the basic page layout, the header, navigation styling, and so on.</p>
                   <pre><code>/* || SITEWIDE */

.main-nav { ... }

.logo { ... }</code></pre>
                <p>Finally we will include CSS for specific things, broken down by the context, page or even component in which they are used.</p>
                <pre><code>/* || STORE PAGES */

.product-listing { ... }

.product-box { ... }</code></pre>
                <p>By ordering things in this way, we at least have an idea in which part of the stylesheet we will be looking for something that we want to change.</p>
